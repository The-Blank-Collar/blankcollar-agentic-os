## 🧠 What is Blank Collar?

**Blank Collar** is an open, local‑first **Agentic Operating System** designed to run an entire
AI‑powered company — products, support, sales, ops, content, finance — from a single dashboard.

Where most agent frameworks expose raw agents, terminals, and prompts, Blank Collar exposes
**business goals**. You hire a "department," set a goal, and the system orchestrates agents,
tools, and memory to deliver outcomes.

**Why "Blank Collar"?**
We're past white‑collar and blue‑collar. The future workforce wears no collar at all.

---

## 🎯 Philosophy: Goal‑First, Not Agent‑First

Most agent platforms make you think like a developer:

> "Spin up an agent → give it a prompt → wire its tools → watch the logs."

**Blank Collar flips that.** You think like a CEO:

> "Grow newsletter signups by 10% this month."
> "Process every invoice that hits agent@blankcollar.ai."
> "Onboard new customers within 24 hours of purchase."

The OS translates goals into:
- **Departments** (Marketing, Sales, Support, Finance, Engineering, …)
- **Roles** within each department (Lead, Specialist, Reviewer)
- **Skills & tools** the role needs (MCP tools, integrations, knowledge)
- **Agents** that execute the work — chosen and configured by the OS

You manage **outcomes**, the OS manages **execution**.

## 🧭 The Four Cs — How the OS is organised

Every backend module belongs to one of four pillars. New code that doesn't map to one is a smell.

| Pillar          | Question it answers       | Where it lives                                                                       |
|-----------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Context**     | *What does the OS know?*  | `gbrain` (semantic recall) + `Graphiti` (temporal graph) + `ops.knowledge_doc` (wiki) |
| **Connections** | *What can it reach?*      | `Nango` (400+ services) + Google Workspace connectors + `apps/email-ingest`           |
| **Capabilities**| *What can it do?*         | Skills Engine (`packages/skills/`) routed through Hermes / OpenClaw / LangGraph       |
| **Cadence**     | *When does it act?*       | Routines Engine — scheduler in Paperclip + event-triggered routines + audit-driven    |

Operating modes — every component is **mode-aware**:
- **Single-user** (personal AIOS) — one human, one org, role=`owner`, dept=`NULL`. `make personal` lands you here.
- **Multi-user** (company / team) — multiple humans + departments, role-scoped, RLS-enforced.

The same data model serves both; the difference is which scopes are populated. See [`docs/INTEGRATION_PLAN.md`](docs/INTEGRATION_PLAN.md) for how the Four Cs connect end-to-end and how each new feature wires into the existing pipeline.

## ⚡ Quick Start (Mac + Docker Desktop)

### Prerequisites

| Tool             | Minimum version | Install                                                       |
|------------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| macOS            | 13+             | —                                                             |
| Docker Desktop   | 4.30+           | https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop                |
| Git              | 2.40+           | `brew install git`                                            |
| Make (optional)  | any             | preinstalled                                                  |

> Make sure Docker Desktop is **running** (whale icon in the menu bar) before continuing.

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/The-Blank-Collar/blankcollar-agentic-os.git
cd blankcollar-agentic-os
```

### 2. Copy the example env file

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

> Open `.env` in your editor. For Phase 0 (groundwork) you don't need to fill any
> external API keys — the data layer runs locally.

### 3. Start the stack

```bash
docker compose up -d
# …or, if you prefer the ergonomic wrappers:
make bootstrap
```

> Run `make help` to see every shortcut (`up`, `down`, `doctor`, `psql`, `logs`, `reset`, …).

This brings up:
- **PostgreSQL** on `localhost:5432`
- **Qdrant** on `localhost:6333` (REST) / `localhost:6334` (gRPC)
- **Paperclip placeholder** on http://localhost:3000
- **Hermes placeholder** on http://localhost:8001
- **OpenClaw placeholder** on http://localhost:8002
- **gbrain placeholder** on http://localhost:8003

### 4. Verify everything is healthy

```bash
./infra/scripts/doctor.sh
```

Expected output: ✅ for every service.

### 5. Open the placeholder dashboard

Visit **http://localhost:3000** — you should see the Paperclip placeholder page.

> [`docs/LOCAL_SETUP.md`](docs/LOCAL_SETUP.md)

### Stopping the stack

```bash
docker compose down            # stop containers, keep data
docker compose down -v         # stop AND wipe data (fresh slate)
./infra/scripts/reset.sh       # interactive reset with confirmation
```

## 🔐 Roles & Scoped Access

From day one, Blank Collar is built for **multi‑user, role‑based** access.
You should never give an intern‑level agent the keys to billing.

| Role               | Sees                                  | Can do                                              |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Owner**          | Everything                            | Manage company, billing, users, all goals           |
| **Department Lead**| Their department's goals & memory     | Create goals, manage department agents              |
| **Team Member**    | Assigned goals only                   | Execute, comment, raise blockers                    |
| **Auditor**        | Read‑only across the company          | Inspect runs, exports, compliance                   |
| **Agent (system)** | Whatever the role grants it           | Tool calls scoped by the role of the goal owner     |

Scoping is enforced at three layers:
1. **API**: every request carries a role; controllers check it.
2. **gbrain**: memory queries are filtered by `(department, role, goal_id)`.
3. **Tools**: skills & MCP tools are gated by role policy.

> 📚 Roles deep dive: [`docs/ROLES.md`](docs/ROLES.md)

---

## 🧠 The Company Brain

The **Company Brain** = `gbrain` + Qdrant + PostgreSQL working as one.

- **Facts**: structured truths about the company ("we charge $29/mo", "our brand voice is …").
- **Episodic memory**: what happened, when, by which agent, on which goal.
- **Semantic memory**: documents, conversations, knowledge — embedded into Qdrant.
- **Scoped retrieval**: every read is filtered by role + department + goal.

The Brain is **persistent across runs and agents**. A new agent hired tomorrow inherits
the company's collective memory the moment it's onboarded.

> 📚 Brain design: [`docs/COMPANY_BRAIN.md`](docs/COMPANY_BRAIN.md)

## ✅ QA & Debugging Checklist

Run through this **before merging any PR** and **after every `docker compose up`** during
development.

- [ ] `docker compose ps` — every service shows `running` / `healthy`
- [ ] `./infra/scripts/doctor.sh` exits 0
- [ ] Postgres reachable: `psql postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/blankcollar -c "\dt"`
- [ ] Qdrant reachable: `curl -s http://localhost:6333/healthz`
- [ ] Paperclip placeholder responds: `curl -s http://localhost:3000`
- [ ] No errors in `docker compose logs --tail=200`
- [ ] `.env` is **not** committed (run `git status` and confirm)
- [ ] `.env.example` lists every variable used in `docker-compose.yml`
- [ ] No service hardcodes secrets — everything via env
- [ ] Volumes named with `bc_` prefix so they don't collide with other projects
- [ ] README screenshots / examples still match reality

- **Email ingestion** (`agent@blankcollar.ai`) — webhook placeholder in roadmap
- **Skills marketplace / MCP registry** — `packages/` ready to host
- **Multi‑department orgs** — schema in `infra/docker/postgres/init.sql`
